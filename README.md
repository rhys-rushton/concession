# concession
- Two groups
- Those below 16 and above 65
- Those in between

- Below 16 and above 65 
    - What I want to do is: 
        - Go through each attendance and check if they have a correspondening 10990
    - If they do then ignore
    - If not then add to list of people who need one

- In the middle
    - Filter all attendances that have a corresponding 10990
    - Go through each one on Zedmed and add eligible people to dataframe of those eligible

- Next steps 
    - Clean up
    - Add a GUI - Use electron
    - Add a way to bill item numbers


Js front end/ typescript backend for most stuff (Servers etc) - python for data stuff and ai stuff etc (maybe some c++)
